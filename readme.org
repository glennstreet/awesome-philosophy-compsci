“The nLab is a collaborative wiki. It grew out of the desire (I, II) to have a place for development (the ’Lab’ in ’nLab’) and indexed archives of the ideas and concepts surrounding the discussions at the The n-Category Café. These discussions primarily are about mathematics, physics and philosophy from the perspective of category theory and higher category theory (the ’n’ in ’nLab’ and nPOV).“

** [[https://arend-lang.github.io/about/][Arend Theorem Prover]]
‘Arend implements a version of [[https://homotopytypetheory.org][homotopy type theory]] with an interval type, which syntax is similar to [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory][cubical type theory]]. This implies several nice properties of path types and allows for a simple and clean definition of higher inductive types (including recursive ones).’

It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the [[https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/List%2520of%2520Coq%2520PL%2520Projects][certification of properties of programming languages]] (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching."

‘GAPT is a proof theory framework developed primarily at the Vienna University of Technology. GAPT contains data structures, algorithms, parsers and other components common in proof theory and automated deduction. In contrast to automated and interactive theorem provers whose focus is the construction of proofs, GAPT concentrates on the transformation and further processing of proofs.’

**** [[https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/][The Common Lisp Cookbook]]
**** [[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/][Practical Common Lisp]]  
"If you think the greatest pleasure in programming comes from getting a lot done with code that simply and clearly expresses your intention, then programming in Common Lisp is likely to be about the most fun you can have with a computer. You'll get more done, faster, using it than you would using pretty much any other language."
*** [[https://clojure.org][Clojure]]
*** [[https://schemers.org][Scheme]]
** [[https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/04/logica-organizing-your-data-queries.html][Logica]]
  ‘We present Logica, a novel open source Logic Programming language. A successor to Yedalog (a language developed at Google earlier) it is a Datalog-like logic programming language. Logica code compiles to SQL and runs on Google BigQuery (with experimental support for PostgreSQL and SQLite), but it is much more concise and supports the clean and reusable abstraction mechanisms that SQL lacks. It supports modules and imports, it can be used from an interactive Python notebook and it even makes testing your queries natural and easy.’
